# EXInstaller
Instalador simple y bonito

## About

EXInstaller is a deploy software to install any third party program.

### The project

EXInstaller was programmed in Visual Studio 2010 with the WinForms or VB.NET language.

It is currently being developed without the help of Worcome Studios.

Currently you can help us with some little things that we still can't add, it would be great.

### Using it
[> Recommended to read the real use guide <](http://crz-labs.rf.gd/EXInstaller/docs.html)
  1) You must first create the service file.
  2) Then you must start the EXInstallerIDE
    * In the Assembly box you must enter the "AssemblyName" set in the service file.
    * In the Version box you must enter the "AssemblyVersion" set in the service file.
    * In the URL box you must enter the direct download link of the service file.
  3) When you click on "Inject", the program will ask you to select EXInstaller.exe to be able to inject into it. Another executable will be created with the name of the assembly, that is ready for deployment.
  4) Ready!. The installer is ready to distribute.
